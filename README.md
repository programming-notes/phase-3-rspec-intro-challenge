# Phase 3 RSpec Intro Challenge

## Summary

This is an after-hours challenge, designed to prepare you for tomorrow's work. Push forward with your Rails apps. Make sure you've practiced the topics outlines in the Rails Blog challenge.

Tomorrow we'll be diving into automated testing—the art of using computer programs to test your code rather than manual human labor. The driver code you've become accustomed to writing since Phase 1 is actually a form of automated testing. The driver code runs through your methods and helps ensure that they generally execute and return results as you would expect.

We’ll be moving from driver code to testing with RSpec, the samurai sword of Ruby/Rails automated testing.

Review the following documents.

- [RSpec code example](./basic_rspec.md)
- [RSpec terms and features](.rspec_overview.md)

Take a look at the official documentation.
- [Relish RSpec docs](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/)

  In particular, try to familiarize yourself with the basic structure of RSpec, hooks, subject, built-in matchers, custom matchers, mocks, and RSpec with Rails. You'll find documentation on each of these topics.


## Releases
Take a Ruby class of your choice (feel free to pick something from your Phase 1 exercises) and write an RSpec test suite with at least 3 passing examples that describe its behavior.
